# Scrambled-Text-Translator-
This Python project explores human reading comprehension by transforming scrambled words into readable text while maintaining the first and last letters of each word in the correct position. According to research, humans can read jumbled words as long as the outer letters are in the right places, allowing the brain to interpret the word as a whole.
